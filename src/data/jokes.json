      "joke": "I don't trust stairs.",
      "punchline": "They are always up to something.",
      "why": "This joke is funny because of the double meaning of 'up to something'—referring both to the stairs leading upwards and the idiomatic expression for scheming."
    },
    {
      "joke": "Today, my son asked, 'Can I have a bookmark?'",
      "punchline": "I burst into tears—11 years old and he still doesn't know my name is Brian.",
      "why": "The humor arises from the play on words where 'bookmark' is misinterpreted as 'Mark,' suggesting the son doesn't know his father's name."
    },
    {
      "joke": "Why didn’t Han Solo enjoy his steak dinner?",
      "punchline": "It was Chewie.",
      "why": "This joke is a pun on the name 'Chewie' (Chewbacca from Star Wars) and the word 'chewy,' describing the texture of tough meat."
    },
    {
      "joke": "Why do you never see elephants hiding in trees?",
      "punchline": "Because they’re so good at it.",
      "why": "The joke's humor lies in the absurdity of the idea, suggesting elephants are hiding in trees so well that they're never seen."
    },
    {
      "joke": "Did you hear about the racing snail who got rid of his shell?",
      "punchline": "He thought it would make him faster, but it just made him sluggish.",
      "why": "This joke plays on the dual meaning of 'sluggish': slow and lethargic, and like a slug (a snail without a shell)."
